***Minimum Viable Product (MVP)***  
*Weather Application: DROPLET*

1. Consider a logo.
2. Consider adding click functionality to the cards that will take the user to a more detailed view of the weather in the corresponding city.
3. Consider creating a CONTACT US page and an ABOUT US page.
4. Enlarge cards on hover.
5. Incorporate droplet-weather-app-detailed-forecast docs into main app.  Find out how to make the detailed forecast populate when a city card is clicked from the main page.
